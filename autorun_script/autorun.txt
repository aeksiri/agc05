Step 1: Write a script which contains ros commands like roslaunch, roscore, etc.The script would
look somewhat like this:
#! /bin/bash
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
roslaunch hokuyo_node hokuyo_test.launch

Note the second line source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash this is the path of ros bash. We need to
source ros setup in our script before we use any of the ros commands.

Step 2: Make the script executable by using command
sudo chmod +x /path/to/script.sh

Step 3: Go to System -->Preferences --> Startup Application

Step 4: click on add application or add tab, a window would popup. Add name say "rosnome"

Step 5: On the given window in the command tab type
gnome-terminal -x /path/to/script.sh

Step 6: type whatever you want on the comment space or leave blank and click add

Step 7: On the terminal Edit -->profile preferences-->title and command tab select when command
exits hold the terminal open

Step 8: reboot system and your application would auto start on boot every time.

Note: It is not possible or rather a bit difficult job to open multiple terminals from a single script so
it is recommended to use a single ros launch file for the entire robot which would include
everything.
